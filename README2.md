# hello-world
One foot in front of the other to start the journey
I am looking forward to the confusion and brain numbing learning. This has been something I have talked about doing for long enough. No telling where this is going but hopefully along with freshly enrolling in college I will be able to reinvigorate my career and see it grow. I have no delusion to it being quick and thats okay because the more you work for something the more meaning it has to you.
